## The Struggle Every Parent Knows

It's 5 PM on a Tuesday. You tell your daughter, "You have thirty minutes until dinner."

She hears infinity.

By dinner time, she's still immersed in her activity—not because she's ignoring you, but because she genuinely can't *feel* time passing. Sound familiar?

This scene plays out daily in homes everywhere. The morning routine takes twice as long. Homework sessions end in frustration. Transitions between activities trigger meltdowns. And the hardest part? Your child isn't being difficult—they're experiencing time differently than you.

Many children struggle to understand time as an abstract concept. Whether it's difficulty with focus, executive function challenges, or simply being young, millions of kids need help making time tangible.

**What if you could make time visible—and fun?**

## Enter FocusPal: Where Time Meets Adventure

FocusPal is an iOS app designed to help children understand time visually while making focus feel like play. It's not just another countdown clock—it's a complete family productivity system that transforms time management into an engaging adventure.

## Five Beautiful Timer Themes

Every child is different. That's why FocusPal offers five unique visual timer experiences:

### Classic Timer
A modern ring-style progress indicator with a pulsing glow effect. Clean, elegant, and easy to read. The ring depletes clockwise as time passes, with colors shifting from blue to orange to red as the timer runs low.

### Space Explorer
Blast off into orbit! Watch a rocket circle a glowing planet as twinkling stars animate in the background. The fuel gauge depletes as time passes. Perfect for kids who love space and adventure.

### Ocean Adventure
Dive into an underwater world! Water drains from the tank as time passes, with colorful fish swimming by and bubbles floating up. Complete the timer to find the treasure chest!

### Progress Bar
A simple, straightforward horizontal bar for children who prefer linear visuals. Great for kids who like to see exactly how much time is left at a glance.

### Analog Clock
A traditional clock-style display with a sweeping hand for kids learning to read analog clocks.

**All timers feature:**
- Milestone celebrations at 75%, 50%, and 25% remaining
- Confetti burst animation on completion
- Smooth color transitions as time runs low
