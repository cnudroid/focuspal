## The Struggle Every Parent Knows

It's 5 PM on a Tuesday. You tell your daughter, "You have thirty minutes until dinner."

She hears infinity.

By dinner time, she's still immersed in her activity—not because she's ignoring you, but because she genuinely can't *feel* time passing. Sound familiar?

This scene plays out daily in homes everywhere. The morning routine takes twice as long. Homework sessions end in frustration. Transitions between activities trigger meltdowns. And the hardest part? Your child isn't being difficult—they're experiencing time differently than you.

Many children struggle to understand time as an abstract concept. Whether it's difficulty with focus, executive function challenges, or simply being young, millions of kids need help making time tangible.

**What if you could make time visible—and fun?**

## Enter FocusPal: Where Time Meets Adventure

FocusPal is an iOS app designed to help children understand time visually while making focus feel like play. It's not just another countdown clock—it's a complete family productivity system that transforms time management into an engaging adventure.

## The Kids Task Flow: Your Child's Command Center

At the heart of FocusPal is the **Today tab**—a kid-friendly dashboard where children see their day at a glance. No complicated menus, no confusing interfaces. Just colorful task cards they can tap to start focusing.

### How Tasks Work for Kids

**Active Tasks** - "Happening Now"
When it's time for homework or reading, the task appears with a bright orange "NOW" badge. One tap opens the timer, and your child is off to focus. No negotiation required—the app tells them it's time.

**Upcoming Tasks** - "Coming Up"
Kids can see their next three activities with times and durations. This builds anticipation and reduces transition anxiety. "After piano practice, it's free time!"

**Completed Tasks** - "Today's Wins"
Every finished task moves to a collapsible "wins" section with satisfying checkmarks. Kids love seeing their accomplishments pile up throughout the day.

### Task Cards Made for Kids

Each task card shows:
- **Category icon** (books for reading, calculator for math, musical note for practice)
- **Task name** ("Reading Time", "Math Practice")
- **Scheduled time** with duration badge ("3:30 PM • 30 min")
- **Start Timer button** - big, colorful, impossible to miss

A friendly clock mascot at the top changes expression based on activity level—smiling when they're productive, sleeping when it's quiet. Kids love watching its mood change!

### Points as You Go

Every minute of focus earns points. The points summary sits prominently at the top:
- **Today's Points** with a star icon
- **Streak indicator** ("Keep it up!" with a flame)
- Real-time updates as timers complete

## Five Beautiful Timer Themes

Every child is different. That's why FocusPal offers five unique visual timer experiences:

### Classic Timer
A modern ring-style progress indicator with a pulsing glow effect. Clean, elegant, and easy to read. The ring depletes clockwise as time passes, with colors shifting from blue to orange to red as the timer runs low.

### Space Explorer
Blast off into orbit! Watch a rocket circle a glowing planet as twinkling stars animate in the background. The fuel gauge depletes as time passes. Perfect for kids who love space and adventure.

### Ocean Adventure
Dive into an underwater world! Water drains from the tank as time passes, with colorful fish swimming by and bubbles floating up. Complete the timer to find the treasure chest!

### Progress Bar
A simple, straightforward horizontal bar for children who prefer linear visuals. Great for kids who like to see exactly how much time is left at a glance.

### Analog Clock
A traditional clock-style display with a sweeping hand for kids learning to read analog clocks.

**All timers feature:**
- Milestone celebrations at 75%, 50%, and 25% remaining
- Confetti burst animation on completion
- Smooth color transitions as time runs low
- Audio callouts at key intervals (optional)

## Daily Gift Box Surprise

Every day starts with excitement! When your child opens FocusPal for the first time each day, a shaking gift box awaits them.

## Starting a Timer: One Tap and Go

When your child taps a task card or the floating "Start Timer" button, a beautiful timer overlay appears. No navigation needed—they're instantly in focus mode.

![Today Tab Overview](/focuspal/assets/images/screenshots/today-overview.png)

The timer overlay shows:
- Their chosen visual theme (rocket, ocean, or classic ring)
- The category they're working on with its color
- Time remaining in large, kid-friendly numbers
- A simple pause/stop control

When the timer completes, confetti bursts across the screen, points are awarded, and the task moves to "Today's Wins." Your child feels accomplished, and you didn't have to nag once.

## Setting Up Your Child's Day

Parents create the schedule, kids follow it. From the Parent Dashboard, you can:

- **Create Recurring Tasks**: Daily homework at 4 PM, weekly piano practice on Tuesdays
- **Set Time Goals**: "At least 30 minutes of reading per day"
- **Define Categories**: Custom activities with icons, colors, and point multipliers
- **Sync with Calendar**: Tasks from iOS Calendar appear automatically

When scheduled time arrives, the task appears in your child's Today tab with a bright "NOW" badge. They tap, the timer starts, and focus begins. No negotiations, no reminders—the app handles it.

### Category Types

- **Task Categories** (Homework, Reading, Chores): Kids earn points when completed
- **Reward Categories** (Screen Time, Gaming): Cost points to start

This creates a natural balance—kids earn time for fun activities by completing responsibilities first. "I need 50 more points for 30 minutes of gaming" is a lot more motivating than "Do your homework!"

## Parent Dashboard

A PIN-protected (or Face ID) parent area gives you insights without being intrusive.
