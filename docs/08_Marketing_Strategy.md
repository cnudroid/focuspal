Subject: Partnership opportunity - ADHD timer app for kids

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content about [specific topic] and
love how you [specific compliment].

I'm reaching out from FocusPal, a new iOS app designed
specifically for kids with ADHD. We built it because most
timer apps assume users can naturally feel time passing -
which doesn't work for kids with time blindness.

Key features:
- Visual timers (Time Timer style) that make time visible
- Multi-child family support
- Gamified rewards that actually motivate
- Weekly parent reports

Would you be interested in trying it with your family?
I'd love to offer you a free premium subscription and
discuss a potential partnership.

Best,
[Name]

## 8. PR & Media Strategy

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FocusPal Launches: The First Family Productivity App
Designed Specifically for ADHD Minds

[City, Date] – FocusPal, a new iOS app, addresses a critical gap
in the productivity app market by creating tools specifically
designed for children with ADHD and executive function challenges.

"Most timer apps assume users can naturally feel time passing,"
says [Founder Name]. "For the 6+ million children in the US with
ADHD, time blindness makes traditional timers useless. FocusPal
makes time visible."

THE PROBLEM
Children with ADHD often experience "time blindness" – difficulty
perceiving how much time has passed or estimating how long tasks
will take. This leads to:
- Difficulty transitioning between activities
- Homework meltdowns
- Morning routine chaos
- Struggles with time management skills

THE SOLUTION
FocusPal combines research-backed visual timers with activity
tracking and gamification:
- Visual timers that show time disappearing (Time Timer® approach)
- Multi-child family support (up to 8 profiles)
- Points, badges, and rewards that motivate
- Weekly parent reports via email
- COPPA compliant, privacy-first design

MARKET OPPORTUNITY
- 6+ million children in the US have ADHD
- Physical visual timers cost $25-40 with limited functionality
- No existing app combines timer + tracking + gamification for families

AVAILABILITY
FocusPal is available now on the App Store with a freemium model.
Premium features are $4.99/month or $39.99/year.
